# About

This is a C++ Virtual File System library demo that allows manipulation of files from memory or native filesystems. My purpose to build this is used to Network File System. It is just so simple and single. The future maybe build with more new feature.

> Note: his library requires C++17 or later

## Example

README will be improved in the future......
